        <h1>About me </h1>

        "I am a seasoned DevOps Engineer with 10 years of experience, 
        specializing in cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure. 
        My expertise includes CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation),
        container orchestration with Kubernetes, and configuration management using Ansible, Chef, and Puppet
        I have strong hands-on experience in monitoring with Grafana, Prometheus, and ELK Stack. 
        Additionally, I have worked on cloud migrations, security best practices, and 
        optimizing system performance. Currently, I am seeking a contract C2C role
         where I can leverage my skills in cloud automation, Kubernetes, 
         and DevOps to drive efficiency and scalability."
